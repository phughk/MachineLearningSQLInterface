The idea behind this project is to provide data exploration algorithms on top of an SQL interface.

The SQL credentials should be provided as parameter variables or environment variables as described below (TODO).

After the application is launched there should be a terminal or web interface for selecting algorithms for data exploration.

Temporarily this will function as a test ground for algorithms.
